# Low-maintenance publication policy

Freeze editorial URLs after the initial release. Do not run scheduled article generators, rewrite text daily, or change dates without a substantive correction. Ads and optional comments remain disabled. GA4 has its own web stream and loads only after optional-analytics consent; the privacy notice reflects this. Verify live collection separately from configuration.

Update only for: a major game change that invalidates a guide; a material factual error; a valuable new search intent; a GSC content gap; a technical/indexing fault; or a changed official game entry or important rule. New codes need a developer source and successful same-game validation. A video title alone is insufficient for a mechanic guide.

The initial edition has resource coverage and a documented Stand acquisition guide. Beginner progression, a complete current Stand roster and other game data remain deferred in `research/page-matrix.md`. Do not publish their empty routes or fill them with JoJo lore or mechanics from another Roblox game.

## Checks after publication

Use the deployment acceptance date in `reports/online-acceptance.json` as day 0. If that file does not show a verified deployment, the clock has not started.

| Day | Check | Action only when warranted |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | HTTPS, official game link, all sitemap URLs, Pagefind and GSC verification if accessible | Fix an actual break or complete authorized account setup |
| 7 | GSC sitemap status and indexed pages; 7/30-day Trends if available | Distinguish unindexed from indexed-but-low-ranking; no forced content rewrite |
| 14 | GSC impressions/queries/clicks and GA4 Organic Search if enabled and verified | Address a demonstrated content or CTR gap with supported facts |
| 28 | Trend direction, indexed-page exposure, useful long tails, competition and maintenance time | Continue, freeze further investment, or add only a proven valuable page |

Four single-run thread checks were created in the app: October 14, October 18, October 25 and November 8, 2026, at 12:00 in the local schedule (Asia/Shanghai). IDs are morioh-high-3, morioh-high-7, morioh-high-14 and morioh-high-28. The saved automation prompts permit public technical checks and account measurements only when already authorized and accessible, keep quiet when no action is needed, and prohibit automatic article generation. Creation is verified; future execution is not yet verified. Keep the computer and app running for local project access.

GSC ownership and both index/child sitemap submission dialogs are verified. Its sitemap report still says Couldn't fetch / 0 discovered pages, despite valid public XML and a successful Google live fetch on October 11. Recheck processing status; do not confuse that error with proven site-wide crawl failure. GA4 consent-gated production collection is verified in the correct property: one operator test user and two page views. Organic Search, Google indexing and impressions remain unverified.

## Measurement rules

Track GSC impressions, clicks, query/page rankings, indexed page count; verified GA4 Organic Search sessions; and, later, actual ad impressions/RPM/revenue. Do not estimate revenue from missing analytics. Separate: not indexed; indexed with low rank; ranked with little demand; impressions with weak CTR.

Stop adding paid effort if measured heat falls persistently, indexed content has no meaningful exposure over an appropriate observation period, long-tail demand is limited, competition wins decisively, or maintenance exceeds plausible value. Retain a working low-cost static site if useful. No automatic deletion is required.

## Recovery and deployment

Read `reports/current-delivery-status.md`, inspect Git and the evidence ledger, then resume the unfinished step. Node >=22.13, pnpm 11.1.1. Install with the frozen lockfile. The Windows optional-native repair is documented in `scripts/repair-windows-deps.ps1`; use only if a native package download failed.

For content edits, run the template's content and link gates plus the appropriate build checks. For a deployment, build with the verified `SITE_URL` and run the build SEO audit; deploy `dist` through Wrangler using credentials supplied in the process environment. Never put tokens in tracked files. Recheck the live sitemap, canonical origin, 404 status and search after upload.

A future custom domain must be owned/authorized, pass the cost decision, and be bound before changing the primary origin. Rebuild canonical/sitemap metadata at that point, update the real domain mailbox, and verify mail routing separately. Avoid indexing two hosts with conflicting canonical signals.


## 2026-10-11 formal domain/email handoff

User-owned domain: moriohhighguide.wiki (Spaceship). Public mailbox: contact@moriohhighguide.wiki, forwarding to the privately provided, already verified Gmail. Cloudflare zone, Pages association, apex CNAME and exact forwarding rule are saved and verified. Nameservers must become armfazh.ns.cloudflare.com / laura.ns.cloudflare.com; public DNS still uses Spaceship and the zone is pending. Routing enable returned Active zone required. Do not publish the contact address or switch production Canonical/Sitemap until activation and service/HTTPS checks pass. Read reports/domain-email-handoff.md and existing receipts to resume without recreating rules or properties. Delivery testing is still outstanding.
