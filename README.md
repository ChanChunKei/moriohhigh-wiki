# Morioh High Wiki

Independent English player resources for Roblox Morioh High. Not affiliated with Not A Stand Game, Roblox Corporation, or JoJo rights holders.

- Cloudflare project origin: https://moriohhigh-wiki.pages.dev (deployment acceptance is tracked in reports/online-acceptance.json).
- Repository: https://github.com/ChanChunKei/moriohhigh-wiki
- Source: AnvilWiki 2.37.0, commit b00859a524a176d60f3982c71b318ac11bc2fd5b. MIT license retained; original README preserved in docs/anvilwiki-upstream-README.md.

The current edition contains the homepage, Roblox launch/identity guide, documented Stand acquisition, release information, community resources and FAQ. The Stand guide reads the game Encyclopedia in actual footage and checks a second player's Arrow recording; this wiki has not joined a live game client. A hands-on beginner route, complete Stand data and codes remain withheld. See research/page-matrix.md and research/evidence-ledger.md. Do not describe this scope as a complete gameplay encyclopedia.

User keyword research dated October 11, 2026 is preserved unchanged in research/user-keywords-2026-10-11.md and .json. Incremental research is separate. Unknown search volumes and KD remain null.

## Local development

Node >=22.13.0 and pnpm 11.1.1. Install with pnpm install --frozen-lockfile. Run pnpm dev or pnpm build followed by pnpm preview. If optional Windows native downloads failed, use scripts/repair-windows-deps.ps1; the repair verifies npm dist.integrity.

Configuration is concentrated in src/config/site.ts, src/config/navigation.ts, src/config/indexing.ts and src/locales/en.json. SITE_URL must be an actual local or allocated publication URL. Pagefind is produced during postbuild. Ads remain disabled. GA4 uses the native consent-gated loader and this site’s independent web stream; its public identifiers are in wrangler.toml. Update the privacy notice whenever enabled services change.

## Validation and release

Run pnpm check, pnpm lint, pnpm test, pnpm check-config, pnpm check-content, pnpm check-links, pnpm build and node tools/audit-build.mjs. Run pnpm check-sitemap with BASE_URL pointing to the static preview or verified live site. The retained template-only fixture suites are documented in reports/technical-audit.md.

Deploy dist with Wrangler using process-environment credentials. Never commit tokens. The current Cloudflare project uses direct upload; repository pushes run validation and do not automatically upload a deployment. No permanent deployment credential has been saved to GitHub. The direct-upload wrapper publishes the native deployment SHA marker. IndexNow submission is manual by default; automatic CI submission requires explicit INDEXNOW_AUTO_SUBMIT opt-in and a matching live deployment. IndexNow is separate from Google Search Console.

Read MAINTENANCE.md for the publication freeze and day 3/7/14/28 checks. Start recovery from reports/current-delivery-status.md. Formal domain, working domain mailbox, GSC, GA4 collection and Google exposure require separate verified states.
